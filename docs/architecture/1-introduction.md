# 1. Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for the Peak Finance application. It synthesizes the requirements from the PRD, and UI/UX Specification into a technical blueprint designed to guide development. This architecture prioritizes type safety, performance, security, and maintainability.

The chosen platform is a combination of **Vercel** for hosting and serverless functions, and **Supabase** for the PostgreSQL database and user authentication. This provides a robust, scalable, and developer-friendly foundation.
