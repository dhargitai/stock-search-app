# 9. Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Core business logic, utility functions, and individual React components will be tested in isolation using Vitest and React Testing Library.
- **Integration Tests**: tRPC procedures will be tested to ensure they correctly interact with the Prisma client and implement business logic as expected. Mocking will be used for the database and external APIs.
