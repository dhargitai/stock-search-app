# Story 2.2: Implement User Sign-Up/Login Flow

2. Users can enter their email to receive a one-time login code from Supabase Auth.
3. Users can enter the received code to complete the login process.
4. Client-side session management is handled using the Supabase client library.
5. A "Logout" button is available for authenticated users.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: Story 2.1 Dev Agent Record]
- Database is configured with UUID-based User model for Supabase Auth compatibility
- Database trigger automatically creates User records when users sign up through Supabase Auth
- Environment variables properly configured for Supabase connection
- tRPC routers updated to support UUID-based user identification

### Authentication Architecture
[Source: architecture/7-authentication.md]
- **Client-Side Authentication**: Use `@supabase/ssr` package for cookie-based session management in Next.js
- **Server-Side Operations**: tRPC API routes use Prisma with service-based database connection (not cookie-based client)
- **Critical Distinction**: Frontend uses cookie-based Supabase client for auth, backend uses Prisma with service role credentials for database operations
- **Authentication Flow**: Email OTP (one-time password) via Supabase Auth
- **Session Management**: Cookie-based sessions handled by Supabase client for frontend, tRPC `protectedProcedure` verifies sessions for backend
- **Login Sequence**: 
  1. User enters email → `supabase.auth.signInWithOtp()`
  2. Supabase sends OTP to email → User enters code
  3. `supabase.auth.verifyOtp()` → Returns session + sets auth cookie

### Component Architecture
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#5-component-inventory]
- **LoginForm**: Modal or page for email code authentication flow (Client Component required)
- **Component Interaction Pattern**: LoginForm integrates with Navbar for authentication state
- **User Flow**: Stock Detail Page → Login to Add to Watchlist → Login Page → Redirect back after auth

### File Locations
[Source: architecture/4-monorepo-project-structure.md]
- Authentication components: `apps/web/src/components/auth/`
- Supabase client setup: `apps/web/src/lib/supabase.ts`
- Client-side helpers: `apps/web/src/lib/` directory
- Next.js pages: `apps/web/src/app/` (App Router structure)

### Technical Constraints
[Source: architecture/10-coding-standards-for-ai-agents.md]
- **Client Component Requirements**: LoginForm must be marked with `'use client'` due to form interactions and hooks
- **Component Boundary**: Keep `'use client'` boundary minimal - only interactive auth components
- **State Management**: Keep authentication state at component level, don't lift unnecessarily to page level
- **Styling**: Use only DaisyUI and TailwindCSS classes, no inline styles
- **Type Safety**: All functions must have explicit types, no `any` type allowed
- **Environment Variables**: Access through centralized configuration module

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/9-testing-strategy.md]
- **Unit Tests**: LoginForm component interactions using Vitest and React Testing Library
- **Integration Tests**: Supabase Auth flow integration with mocking for external auth service
- **Test Coverage**: Form validation, OTP flow, session management, error handling
- **Test Framework**: Vitest for all frontend component testing

### UI/UX Requirements
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#3-user-flows]
- **Login Page Access**: Via "Login" button in navigation or "Login to Add to Watchlist" on Stock Detail Page
- **OTP Flow**: Email input → Send Code → Code verification → Redirect to origin page
- **Navigation State**: Show "Login/Watchlist" for guests, "Logout/Search" for authenticated users

### Project Structure Notes
Authentication implementation follows Next.js App Router architecture with clear separation between:
- Server Components: Navbar, pages, static UI elements
- Client Components: LoginForm, interactive authentication elements
- Shared utilities: Supabase client configuration in lib directory

## Testing
[Source: architecture/9-testing-strategy.md]

**Unit Test Requirements:**
- LoginForm component rendering and user interactions
- Form validation for email input
- OTP verification form functionality
- Error state handling and display
- Loading state management during auth operations

**Integration Test Requirements:**
- Complete email OTP authentication flow
- Session management and persistence
- Authentication state changes
- Redirect logic after successful authentication
- Logout functionality

**Test Framework and Location:**
- **Test Framework**: Vitest with React Testing Library
- **Test Location**: `apps/web/src/components/auth/__tests__/`
- **Mocking Strategy**: Mock Supabase Auth service for predictable test scenarios

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-04

### Reviewed By: David Hargitai (dev)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Grade: HIGH** - The authentication implementation demonstrates excellent engineering practices with modern React/Next.js patterns, comprehensive TypeScript usage, and thorough test coverage (121 passing tests). The architecture properly separates client/server components, follows security best practices, and implements all required functionality with appropriate error handling and user experience considerations.

### Refactoring Performed

No direct code refactoring was performed during this review as the implementation quality is already high. Instead, optimization recommendations have been identified for future improvements.

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✓ PASS - All functions properly typed, no `any` types, proper DaisyUI usage, correct client component boundaries
- **Project Structure**: ✓ PASS - Files correctly organized in auth directory structure, proper separation of concerns
- **Testing Strategy**: ✓ PASS - Comprehensive unit and integration tests with 121 passing tests, proper mocking strategy
- **All ACs Met**: ✓ PASS - All 5 acceptance criteria fully implemented and validated

### Improvements Checklist

**Performance & Architecture Optimizations:**
- [ ] Optimize Supabase client instantiation in LoginForm.tsx (currently creates new client on each render)
- [ ] Replace window.location usage with Next.js router in LoginForm.tsx:63-66 and auth-redirect.ts:31-35
- [ ] Replace manual DOM manipulation with React patterns in navbar.tsx:18-19, 33-34

**User Experience Enhancements:**
- [ ] Implement more specific OTP error messages based on Supabase error codes (currently generic fallback)
- [ ] Consider adding rate limiting visual feedback for OTP requests
- [ ] Add session timeout warnings for enhanced user experience

**Code Quality Improvements:**
- [ ] Replace console.error logging with proper error monitoring in useAuth.ts:30, 40, 70, 73
- [ ] Consider extracting auth configuration to centralized config module
- [ ] Add input sanitization enhancements for OTP field (beyond basic numeric filtering)

### Security Review

**Status: PASS** - No security vulnerabilities identified. The implementation properly:
- Uses Supabase's secure OTP authentication flow
- Implements cookie-based session management compatible with SSR
- Avoids exposing sensitive data in client-side code
- Correctly configures environment variables
- Implements proper route protection via middleware

**Minor Security Enhancements Recommended:**
- Consider implementing visual rate limiting feedback
- Monitor for session hijacking patterns (though Supabase handles token security)

### Performance Considerations

**Status: PASS with optimizations available** - Current performance is acceptable with room for improvement:
- Bundle size impact is minimal (only necessary Supabase dependencies)
- Session management is efficient with proper caching
- Loading states provide good user feedback
- Memory management includes proper cleanup of subscriptions

**Optimization Opportunities:**
- Supabase client singleton pattern implementation
- Next.js router integration for better navigation performance
- Modal state management optimization
