### Project Structure Requirements
[Source: architecture/4-monorepo-project-structure.md]

The project must follow this exact monorepo structure:

```
/peak-finance-app
├── apps/
│   └── web/                      # The Next.js application
│       ├── src/
│       │   ├── app/                # Next.js App Router pages and layouts
│       │   ├── components/         # React components (UI, layout)
│       │   ├── lib/                # Client-side helpers (Supabase client)
│       │   └── server/             # Server-side code

```

### Coding Standards Requirements
[Source: architecture/10-coding-standards-for-ai-agents.md]

CRITICAL: All development must adhere to these standards:
- **Type Safety is Paramount**: All functions and variables must have explicit types. The `any` type is forbidden.
- **Environment Variables**: Access environment variables only through a centralized configuration module. Never use `process.env` directly in components or API logic.
- **API Interaction**: All data fetching must be done through tRPC hooks (`api.stock.search.useQuery`). Direct `fetch` calls are not allowed.
- **Database Interaction**: All database operations must go through the Prisma client. No raw SQL queries are permitted.
- **Error Handling**: All tRPC procedures must include structured error handling and return specific tRPC error codes.

### Testing
[Source: architecture/9-testing-strategy.md]

Testing requirements for this story:
- **Unit Tests**: Use Vitest and React Testing Library for testing individual components and utilities
- **Integration Tests**: tRPC procedures will be tested with mocking for database and external APIs
- **Test File Location**: Tests should be colocated with source files or in dedicated `__tests__` directories
- **Configuration**: All test configuration must support TypeScript
- **Standards**: Follow established testing patterns once core setup is complete

### Project Structure Notes
- The current working directory `~/Projects/stock-search-app` will become the monorepo root
- Package manager: Must use pnpm for workspace management
- All packages must be properly configured for TypeScript compilation
- Shared configurations should be placed in `packages/config/` for reuse

## QA Results

### Quality Gate Decision: **PASS** ✅
**Reviewed by:** David Hargitai (dev)  
**Review Date:** 2025-09-03  
**Risk Level:** Low

### Executive Summary
Story 1.1 successfully establishes a robust monorepo foundation with all required technologies and tooling configured according to specifications. The implementation demonstrates strong adherence to architectural standards with proper type safety, structured error handling, and comprehensive test setup.

### Requirements Traceability
✅ **AC1 - Next.js 15 with App Router:** Fully implemented with proper configuration  
✅ **AC2 - TypeScript Configuration:** Strict mode enabled with comprehensive type checking  
✅ **AC3 - TailwindCSS + DaisyUI:** Latest versions (4.x/5.1.x) properly configured  
✅ **AC4 - Core Dependencies:** All libraries installed with correct versions  
✅ **AC5 - Code Quality Tools:** ESLint and Prettier configured with project standards

### Code Quality Assessment

**Strengths:**
- **Type Safety Excellence:** Strict TypeScript configuration with explicit typing throughout
- **Monorepo Architecture:** Clean separation of concerns with proper workspace structure
- **Dependency Management:** Correct version pinning matches architectural requirements
- **tRPC Integration:** End-to-end type safety implemented with proper error handling
- **Database Schema:** Well-structured Prisma schema with proper relations and constraints
- **Testing Foundation:** Vitest configured with React Testing Library and proper mocks

**Technical Highlights:**
- Superjson transformer for tRPC serialization
- Proper Zod validation in API procedures
- Class-variance-authority for component styling
- Structured error formatting with ZodError handling
- Comprehensive test setup with jsdom environment

### Risk Assessment
- **Security Risk:** Low - No exposed secrets, placeholder auth middleware documented
- **Performance Risk:** Low - Proper build optimization with Turbo configured  
- **Maintainability Risk:** Low - Clear structure with shared configurations
- **Test Coverage Risk:** Medium - Minimal test coverage (1 component test only)

### Recommendations

**Priority: Medium**
- Add integration tests for tRPC procedures
- Implement database connection testing
- Add E2E smoke tests for critical paths

**Priority: Low**
- Consider adding pre-commit hooks
- Implement automated dependency updates
- Add performance monitoring setup

### Technical Debt Assessment
- **Minimal Debt:** Placeholder implementations in stock router are documented and acceptable for foundation story
- **No Critical Issues:** All architectural standards properly followed
- **Future Considerations:** Authentication middleware properly stubbed for future implementation

### Test Strategy Validation
- **Unit Testing:** ✅ Properly configured with Vitest + RTL
- **Integration Testing:** ⚠️ Framework ready but no integration tests present
- **Type Checking:** ✅ Comprehensive TypeScript validation in place
- **Linting/Formatting:** ✅ ESLint and Prettier configured correctly

### Compliance Check
✅ All coding standards requirements met  
✅ Environment variable access properly abstracted  
✅ Database interaction through Prisma only  
✅ tRPC procedures include proper error handling  
✅ Type safety enforced throughout stack

**Overall Assessment:** Good foundation implementation that exceeds baseline requirements for a project setup story.
