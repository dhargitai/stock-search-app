### File Locations
[Source: architecture/4-monorepo-project-structure.md]
- Homepage: `apps/web/src/app/page.tsx` (Next.js App Router pages)
- Components: `apps/web/src/components/ui/` for reusable UI components
- Global styles: `apps/web/src/app/globals.css` (already configured with TailwindCSS/DaisyUI)
- Test files: Colocated with components in `__tests__` directories

### Coding Standards Requirements
[Source: architecture/10-coding-standards-for-ai-agents.md]
- **Type Safety Paramount**: All functions and variables must have explicit types, `any` type forbidden
- **Environment Variables**: Access only through centralized configuration module, never `process.env` directly
- **Component Standards**: Follow established React patterns with proper TypeScript interfaces
- **Accessibility**: Include proper ARIA attributes and semantic HTML elements

### Data Models
[Source: architecture/5-data-models-database-schema.md]
No database interaction required for this UI-only story. Future stories will integrate with User and WatchlistItem models for authenticated functionality.

### Project Structure Notes
- Current project structure aligns perfectly with architecture specifications
- All required directories (`apps/web/src/app/`, `apps/web/src/components/`) exist and are properly configured
- TailwindCSS and DaisyUI are already configured and ready for component styling
- TypeScript strict mode configured across the project

### Testing
[Source: architecture/9-testing-strategy.md]
**Unit Test Requirements:**
- Use Vitest and React Testing Library for individual React components
- Test files should be colocated with components in `__tests__` directories
- All test configuration supports TypeScript
- Test component functionality, responsive behavior, and accessibility
- Follow established testing patterns from Story 1.1 setup (example test at `apps/web/src/components/ui/__tests__/button.test.tsx`)
