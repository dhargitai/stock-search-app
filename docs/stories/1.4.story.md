# Story 1.4: Implement Stock Detail Page UI Layout

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** User,
**I want** a well-organized detail page,

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A dynamic route `/[symbol]` is created for the detail view.
2. The page displays the stock's name and symbol prominently.
3. A section is laid out using CSS Grid to display key quote data (e.g., price, change, open, high, low, volume).
4. A container is prepared for the historical price chart.
5. The layout is responsive and mobile-friendly.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: Story 1.3 Dev Agent Record]
- Dynamic route `/[symbol]/page.tsx` already exists with basic structure
- Page correctly handles URL parameter decoding and displays symbol
- Navbar component integrated with consistent site-wide navigation
- TypeScript interface `StockDetailPageProps` already defined with proper async params handling
- DaisyUI styling patterns established with card-based layouts and responsive design
- Basic placeholder structure exists but needs enhancement for proper quote data display

### Tech Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md]
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router - Use Server Components by default
- **Language**: TypeScript 5.x - Strict type safety enforcement required
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS 4.x + DaisyUI 5.1.x - No inline styles, use utility classes only
- **Testing**: Vitest + React Testing Library - Unit tests for all components

### UI/UX Specifications
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]

**Stock Detail Page Layout Requirements:**
- Header section with stock name and symbol prominently displayed
- Grid layout for key quote data (Open, High, Low, Prev. Close)
- Current price and change displayed with color coding (green/red)
- Chart container section sized appropriately for Apache ECharts integration
- Mobile-first responsive design with flexible grid wrapping

**Component Specifications:**
- **StockQuoteCard**: Display key quote metrics in organized grid
- **PriceChart**: Container component ready for future Apache ECharts integration
- Use consistent DaisyUI component patterns (cards, stats, badges)

**Responsive Strategy:**
- Mobile-First design approach
- Flexible grids that wrap to single column on mobile
- Chart container resizes to fit container width
- Proper spacing and typography scaling

### File Locations
[Source: architecture/4-monorepo-project-structure.md]
- **Main Page**: `apps/web/src/app/[symbol]/page.tsx` (exists, needs enhancement)
- **New Components**: `apps/web/src/components/ui/stock-quote-card.tsx`
- **Chart Container**: `apps/web/src/components/ui/price-chart-container.tsx`
- **Test Files**: Colocated in `apps/web/src/components/ui/__tests__/` directory

### Coding Standards Requirements
[Source: architecture/10-coding-standards-for-ai-agents.md]
- **Type Safety Paramount**: All functions and variables must have explicit types, `any` type forbidden
- **Component Architecture**: Components are Server Components by default unless explicitly marked with `'use client'`
- **Client Component Boundaries**: Only mark components as `'use client'` if they require React hooks, browser APIs, or event handlers
- **UI Development**: Always use DaisyUI and TailwindCSS classes, never inline styles or CSS classes
- **State Management**: Keep state in the lowest component that needs it
- **YAGNI Principle**: Remove unused imports, variables, and functions immediately

### Data Interface Specifications
Based on future integration requirements, define TypeScript interfaces for:
- `StockQuoteData`: price, change, percentChange, open, high, low, volume, prevClose
- `StockInfo`: symbol, companyName, lastUpdated
- Component prop interfaces for all created components

### Project Structure Notes
Current project structure aligns with architecture specifications. The existing `/[symbol]/page.tsx` route provides the foundation, but needs enhancement to match the UI/UX specifications for proper quote data display and responsive layout.

## Testing
[Source: architecture/9-testing-strategy.md]

**Unit Test Requirements:**
- Test files should be colocated with components in `__tests__` directories
- Use Vitest and React Testing Library for component testing
- Test responsive behavior using different viewport sizes
- Verify accessibility attributes and ARIA compliance

**Specific Test Cases:**
- StockQuoteCard component with various data inputs and edge cases
- Responsive layout behavior across mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints
- Loading states and skeleton components display correctly
- Error states and error boundary functionality
- Server Component boundaries are maintained (no accidental client-side rendering)
- Navigation and URL parameter handling
- Chart container dimensions and responsive behavior

**Integration Test Requirements:**
- Test complete page layout with all components integrated
- Verify proper DaisyUI styling and theme consistency
- Test accessibility compliance with screen readers
- Performance testing for layout shifts and rendering speed

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-03

### Reviewed By: David Hargitai (dev)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment**: Exceptional implementation quality with comprehensive component architecture and excellent adherence to coding standards. The implementation demonstrates solid understanding of React Server Components, responsive design principles, and TypeScript best practices. All acceptance criteria are fully satisfied with robust error handling and loading states.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: `apps/web/src/components/ui/stock-quote-card.tsx`
  - **Change**: Enhanced currency formatting from manual `$` prefix to proper `Intl.NumberFormat` with currency style
  - **Why**: Improves internationalization support and follows web standards for currency display
  - **How**: Replaced `formatNumber()` with `formatCurrency()` using `style: 'currency', currency: 'USD'` for consistent, locale-aware formatting

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Excellent TypeScript safety, no `any` types, proper async handling
- Project Structure: ✓ Perfect alignment with monorepo structure and component organization  
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Outstanding coverage with 57 passing tests across all components
- All ACs Met: ✓ Complete implementation of all 5 acceptance criteria with comprehensive edge case handling
